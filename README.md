This was my first project at Turing School.  The objective of this was to introduce me to object oriented programming techniques and using a [Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) to store and access data. The Linked List contained a series of song noises such as Deep or Doop.  The Linked List has functionality such as append, prepend, delete, and insert.  The final aspect of the program creates a song using the built-in OSX voice program and read each element in the linked list sequentially.
